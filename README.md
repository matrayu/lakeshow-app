## Introduction

With the rise of ticket fees for both sellers and buyers in the secondary marketplace for event tickets, this app was designed to connect Laker fans with Laker season ticket holders directly. Cutting out the middle man marketplace, by not charging buyers or sellers fees, the ticket prices are inherintely lower then any other other site the buyer chooses to post their tickets.
